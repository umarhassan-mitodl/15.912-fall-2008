Supplementary readings are used to illustrate key concepts in each section of the course. Some of these concepts may be familiar to those who have taken 15.350 / 15.351, Managing Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship. If you have not taken either 15.350 or 15.351, and if you are otherwise unfamiliar with the following concepts:

*   The S curve & the determinants of industry evolution
*   Tools for exploring new markets: The nature of the innovator's dilemma
*   Capturing value: Uniqueness & complementary assets
*   Core concepts in network externalities
*   Why responding to discontinuous technological change is so difficult and what to do about it

...then you may wish to read ahead in the papers that follow. These are also listed in the regular course readings by session, but are here laid out by relevant topic for additional study.
